# Project 4 REAMME

I chose the video game data set because I used to play a lot of video games in high school  and I thought it would be interesting to see what video games were selling. At first the data  set seemed fairly simple, just sales by region with critic and user scores, genre, developer, publisher and year. However, in looking closer at the dataset, more than half of the entries had significant amounts of missing data. Most games from before 2005 and a significant number of Nintendo properties had missing data. This included some of the best selling games of all time such as Super Mario Bros and all the Pokemon Games. As a result, I couldnâ€™t just throw out the N/A data because that would mean dropping more than half the data. Instead I replaced the null values with the mean for the entire data set. 

For my first model I used a lasso regression because I knew my model would probably be really overfit. However, my model was still terrible with an r2 score of 0.0 for the training data and around the same for testing data. For my second model I used a neural network with 10 epochs and 2 hidden layers. Although is performed slightly better, it still performed poorly with an r2 score of 0.098. Overall, I probalby could have done better with managing my null values and with performming grid searching over the neural network.
